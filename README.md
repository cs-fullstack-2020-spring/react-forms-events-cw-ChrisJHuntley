# 20-03-17 React Forms Events CW

#### You aren't rendering a list of dogs.
- Create a new react app called dog-adoption-site
- Create a class based component called `AppContainer` and render it on the page
- Create a component called `AvailableDogs` that renders on the left side of the screen and displays a list of dogs that have been put up for adoption
- Create a component called `AddAdoptionForm` that renders a form with fields dog name, dog age, dog breed, a checkbox for potty trained (check if dog is potty trained), and a selection for dog color (white, brown, black, spotted, other)
- When the form in the `AddAdoptionForm` is submitted display the dog in the `AvailableDogs` component and clear the form fields
